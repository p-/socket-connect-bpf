# socket-connect-bpf

socket-connect-bpf is a Linux command line utility that writes human-readable information about each application that makes new (network) connections to the standard output.

More [sample output](samples/socket-connect-bpf-example.txt).

## Details
socket-connect-bpf is a BPF/eBPF prototype with a kernel probe attached to [`security_socket_connect`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/security.h). Connections to AF_UNSPEC and AF_UNIX are explicitly excluded. 

To resolve IP addresses to hostnames a user probe attached to `getaddrinfo` is used.

Following information about each request is displayed if possible:

| Name          | Description                                              | Sample             |
| --------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Time          | Time at which the connection event was received.         | `17:15:58`         |
| AF            | Address family                                           | `AF_INET`          |
| PID           | Process ID of the process making the request.            | `8549`             |
| Process       | Process path/args of the process making the request.     | `/usr/bin/curl`    |
| User          | Username under which the process is executed.            | `root`             |
| Destination   | IP address and port of the destination.                  | `127.0.0.53:53`    |
| Host          | Hostname (if cached)                                     | `github.com`       |
| AS-Info       | Info about the autonomous system (AS) of the IP address. | `AS36459 (GITHUB)` |

## Use cases

You might want to try `socket-connect-bpf` for the following use cases:

* Check if an application contains analytics.
* Check if your trusted dependencies communicate with the outside world.
* As a less invasive alternative to Kernel modules that provide the same functionality.

## Requirements
* x64 CPU(s)
* Recent Linux Kernel: 4.15 or later
* [Go](https://golang.org/)


## Installation

### Install Binaries
Instructions tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 with Linux Kernel 4.18.

* Install Upstream BCC Tools for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver):

        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4052245BD4284CDD
        echo "deb https://repo.iovisor.org/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/iovisor.list
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install bcc-tools libbcc-examples linux-headers-$(uname -r)

* Extract `socket-connect-bpf-x.y.tar.gz` from a [release](https://github.com/p-/socket-connect-bpf/releases).

### Build code from repository
Step-by-Step instructions for Ubuntu 18.04.2 with Linux Kernel 4.18.

    # Install Go 1.11 or later (if not already installed)
    sudo snap install --classic go

    # Install Upstream BCC Tools for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4052245BD4284CDD
    echo "deb https://repo.iovisor.org/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/iovisor.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install bcc-tools libbcc-examples linux-headers-$(uname -r)

    # Change into a folder of your choice and clone socket-connect-bpf
    git clone https://github.com/p-/socket-connect-bpf.git

    cd socket-connect-bpf
    
    go generate
    go build

## Running:

    sudo ./socket-connect-bpf

### Print all
Print all `-a` also prints the process arguments and the AS information.

    sudo ./socket-connect-bpf -a

### Autonomous System (AS) Information

Information about an autonomous system (AS) that an IP address belongs to is not displayed by default.
It can be turned on with the print all flag `-a`.

    sudo ./socket-connect-bpf -a

#### AS data
AS data of [IPtoASN](https://iptoasn.com/) is used.
The local AS-Number lookup will require some more RAM.

To update the AS data used while developing run:

    ./updateASData.sh

## Development

### Tests
Run tests:

    go test ./...

### IDE
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be used for development. The committed `settings.json` file highlights `*.bpf` files as C files.
